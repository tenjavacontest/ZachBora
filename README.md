ZachBora's ten.java contest plugin for Bukkit

- Using the theme "Entities"
- Tested on craftbukkit-1.7.2-R0.1-20131207.033645-22.jar
- Arena is between coords -10, 63, -10 and 10, 74, 10. So fly near that and create a square of cleared grass if you want

Rules :
- Once a player enters the arena a countdown starts from 10 to 0
- Once the countdown reaches 0, mobs start spawning in waves
- The more players in the arena, the more mobs spawn
- Once all the mobs are dead, the next wave will start
- Once every player leaves the arena or dies, it will reset
- You can configure the waves inside the configuration file
